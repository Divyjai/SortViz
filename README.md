Project Name: SortViz - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Project Description
SortViz is a responsive, interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate the working of various sorting algorithms. Built using React and Tailwind CSS, SortViz aims to help students, educators, and enthusiasts understand how sorting algorithms operate through dynamic animations, color-coded comparisons, and real-time updates.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (Functional Components + Hooks)
Styling: Tailwind CSS
State Management: useState, useEffect
Animation: Manual DOM manipulation with controlled setTimeout
Deployment: GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify


 Key Features
 Multiple Sorting Algorithms:
1) Bubble Sort
2) Selection Sort
3) Insertion Sort
4) Merge Sort
5) Quick Sort

Visual Cues:
Bar graphs representing array elements
Color-coded states: comparing, swapping, sorted
Live transitions between each sorting step


 User Controls:
Change array size (slider)
Adjust sorting speed
Regenerate random array
Start/Pause sorting


 Learning Outcomes
1) Deepened understanding of how common sorting algorithms work
2) Improved skills in React state management and DOM animation
3) Experience with functional components and React hooks
4) Styling and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
5) Implementation of clean, reusable components and logic separation


Future Improvements
1) Add Heap Sort, Radix Sort, and more
2) Display real-time step counters
3) Add theoretical explanation panel for each algorithm
4) Include time/space complexity comparison chart
5) Optimize animations using requestAnimationFrame
